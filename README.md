sm2anki
=======
sm2anki is a Python module designed to convert SuperMemo collections containing audio files to Anki.
sm2anki has been tested with:
* Python 2.7.3
* Anki 1.2.8
* SuperMemo 2006 (Build 13.02)

Usage
-----
1. Export your collection from SuperMemo using File -> Export -> As Text. If prompted, do not export the learning process or the repetition history.
2. Run sm2anki.py on the command line providing three arguments:
    1. source: This is the full path to the file exported from SuperMemo in step 1, e.g.: c:/sm_export.txt
    2. media_directory: This is the full path (including the trailing slash) to the directory that contains all media files for a collection. Media files are usually stored in the your_collection/elements directory relative to the location of the .kno file of the collection, e.g.: c:/sm/systems/your_collection/elements/
    3. target: This is the full path to the file that will be created by sm2anki.py and imported into Anki in the next step.
3. Open Anki, create a new deck, and import the file generated by sm2anki.py using File > Import... Use the tab as the delimiter if it is not detected by Anki.
4. Copy the media files from the SuperMemo collection to "new_deck.media" directory in the same directory as the new Anki deck.
